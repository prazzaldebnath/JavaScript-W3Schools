  JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

Meaning: An arrays declared with const must be initialized when it is declared.

Using const without initializing the array is a syntax error:

Example
This will not work:

const cars;
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
Arrays declared with var can be initialized at any time.

You can even use the array before it is declared: -->\
